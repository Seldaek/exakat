name = "Undefined ::class";
description = "::class doesn't check if a corresponding class exists. It must be checked with a call to class_exists().

PHP doesn't raise an error in that case. This happens also with Catch and instanceof commands.

<?php

class foo() {}

// prints foo
echo foo::class; 

// prints bar though bar doesn't exist.
echo bar::class;

?>

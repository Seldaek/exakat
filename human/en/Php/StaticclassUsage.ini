name = "::class";
description = "PHP has a special class constant to hold the name of the class : 'class' keyword. It represents the classname that is used in the left part of the operator.

Using '::class' is safer than relying on a string. It is also faster, though it is a micro-optimisation. 

It is introduced in PHP 5.5.

<?php
class foo {
    public function bar( ) {
        echo ClassName::class; 
    }
}

$f = new Foo( );
$f->bar( );
// return Namespace\ClassName

?>
